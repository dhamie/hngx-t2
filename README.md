## Info

This is a Movie box website created with nextjs(more details below)
extra pacakges included are 'react-icons', 'axois', 'styled-component' and 'react-loading-skeleton' 

The project uses the 'styled-component' as  a base for building custom components with css.
The project also uses the 'The movie database' api to get information shown on the page.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

Due to the way the movie id is gotten as per requirement, when the page is ran/deployed and a user clicks on or searchs for a movie, 
reloading the page causes a 404 error. 

please go back to the index and re-query.

a resolution is being worked on.
